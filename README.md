# covid-19-data

#### As a part of a HackCville course, I wanted to make some visualizations of COVID-19 data that show how the United States is doing relative to other populous countries. 
## I made:
1. A scatter plot that shows number of confirmed cases over time for each of the 10 most populous countries.
2. A scatter plot that shows the amount of new confirmed cases over time for the same 10 countries.
3. A scatter plot that displays the change in new confirmed cases over time for the same 10 countries.
4. A stacked bar plot that shows the number of new cases each day with the amount of cases up to that day stacked on top of them.
